## Section 03: Node.js Module System (Notes App)

In this branch we will develop the first of the four applications that will be developed throughout the course.
The application is called NotesApp. While developing this app we will learn one fundamental feature of nodejs
which is the node module system.

The node module system lets you load external libraries into your application. Thatâ€™ll enable you to take
advantage of built-in Node.js modules as well as third-party npm modules. This includes
libraries for connecting to database, creating web servers, and more!
