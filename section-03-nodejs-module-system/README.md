## Section 03: Node.js Module System (Notes App)

In this branch we will develop the first of the four applications that will be developed throughout the course. The application is called NotesApp.

The node module system lets you load core module as well as  external libraries into your application. Thatâ€™ll enable you to take advantage of built-in Node.js modules as well as third-party npm modules. This includes libraries for connecting to database, creating web servers, and more!

### Use of the Node's Core Modules

In this part of the section, we will learn how to use Node Core Module.
We will learn about the use of the require() function to load in node core module.
To that effect we will load in fs module which stands for File System.

### Use of Node Module System to load in files we created

In this part of the section we are going to use the node module system to load in files that we created. As applications get larger and more complex it become difficult to maintain it if all the code base reside in a single file. Ideally we will want to split up or code in multiple logical chunks so we can stay organized.
